1. DEFINITIONS. "Software" means the identified above 
in binary form, any other machine readable materials 
(including, but not limited to, libraries, source 
files, header files, and data files), any updates or 
error corrections provided by Sun, and any user 
manuals, programming guides and other documentation 
provided to you by Sun under this Agreement. 
"Programs" mean Java applets and applications intended 
to run on the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java 
SE) on Java-enabled general purpose desktop computers

2. LICENSE TO USE. Subject to the terms and conditions 
of this Agreement, including, but not limited to the 
Java Technology Restrictions of the Supplemental 
License Terms, Sun grants you a non-exclusive, 
non-transferable, limited license without license fees 
to reproduce and use internally Software complete and 
unmodified for the sole purpose of running Programs. 
Additional licenses for developers and/or publishers 
are granted in the Supplemental License Terms.

3. RESTRICTIONS. Software is confidential and 
copyrighted. Title to Software and all associated 
intellectual property rights is retained by Sun and/or 
its licensors. Unless enforcement is prohibited by 
applicable law, you may not modify, decompile, or 
reverse engineer Software.  You acknowledge that 
Licensed Software is not designed or intended for use 
in the design, construction, operation or maintenance 
of any nuclear facility. Sun Microsystems, Inc. 
disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness 
for such uses. No right, title or interest in or to 
any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of Sun 
or its licensors is granted under this Agreement. 
Additional restrictions for developers and/or

License Terms.

4. LIMITED WARRANTY.  Sun warrants to you that for a 
period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, 
as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on 
which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of 
defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  
Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  
Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under 
this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to 
replace Software media or refund the fee paid for 
Software. Any implied warranties on the Software are 
limited to 90 days. Some states do not allow 
limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the 
above may not apply to you. This limited warranty 
gives you specific legal rights. You may have others, 
which vary from state to state. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS 
AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED 
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR 
DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED 
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF 
OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, 
EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or 
otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software 
under this Agreement.  The foregoing limitations will 
apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
essential purpose. Some states do not allow the 
exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so 
some of the terms above may not be applicable to you. 

7. TERMINATION.  This Agreement is effective until 
terminated.  You may terminate this Agreement at any 
time by destroying all copies of Software.  This 
Agreement will terminate immediately without notice 
from Sun if you fail to comply with any provision of 
this Agreement.  Either party may terminate this 
Agreement immediately should any Software become, or 
in either party's opinion be likely to become, the 
subject of a claim of infringement of any intellectual 
property right. Upon Termination, you must destroy all 
copies of Software. 

8. EXPORT REGULATIONS. All Software and technical data
